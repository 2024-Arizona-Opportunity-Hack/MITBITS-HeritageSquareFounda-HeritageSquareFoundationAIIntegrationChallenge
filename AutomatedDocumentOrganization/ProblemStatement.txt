Heritage Squareâ€™s google drive is unorganized and difficult to find documents that are needed for marketing, operations, and grants.
AI Agent can assist with finding documents and potentially suggest best ways to reorganize the drives.

AI Agent can add tags or labels to the documents based on high level categories provided. 

Once files are labeled, AI can suggest how to organize the files give specific parameters, ie. group by year/month and then sort by creation dates and then labels. 

Actually move the files into above organized google shared drives.
